**Trading algo SaxoOpenAPI**

This code is the building block to perform a few operations in Python via 
the SaxoOpenAPI. The code will be calibrated for FX products as these are
the one easily available without a subscription. 
The code (under development) is based on the book "Successful algorithmic
trading by _Michael L. Halls-Moore_" adapted to SaxoOpenAPI specifications.

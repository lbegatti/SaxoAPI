**Trading algo SaxoOpenAPI**

This code is the building block to perform a few operations in Python via the SaxoOpenAPI. 
The code will be calibrated for FX products as these are the one easily available without
a subscription. 

The code (ongoing) will perform a few operations: download data, plot relevant graphs,
place, modify and cancel an order.
